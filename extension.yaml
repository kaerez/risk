# Extension Definition File
# This file defines the rules and modifiers for various extensions.
TLP: CLEAR # Default TLP
hide: "none" # "none" to show all, you can include item/section. can also be added inside the extension before/under the version and at the top level before the extensions. E.g. ["Supplemental Metrics", "Environmental (Security Requirements)", "MSC", "MSI"]
disable: "none" # "none" to enable all, you can include item/section. can also be added inside the extension before/under the version and at the top level before the extensions. E.g. "MSA"
default_ext: ["SFDC", "1.0"] # Default extension and version to use if no extension is selected (e.g. initial load without CVSS vector string).
